I opted not to use NUnit or other automated testing tools and not upload the mdf to keep the size of the repo down.

To run the sample:

1) Create the database using the create.sql script in the database folder.  MAKE SURE YOU EDIT THE FILE LOCATION.
2) Edit the app.config so the connection string points to the location of the daatabase you have created.
3) Open the solution in VS2008 or greater and run it.

Should be pretty straightforward.
